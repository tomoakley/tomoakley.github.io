title: Learning addiction
description: Underlying reasons for me to go to University
category: blog
---

<p>A bit of background: I'm a student at a Sixth Form college in the UK and planning on going to University to study Computer Science/Software Engineering in September 2013. I design and develop websites, most of them built on Wordpress for external clients who own small businesses.</p>

<p>I really enjoy both sides of creating a website - the designing and developing in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I like to think I'm pretty proficient in HTML and CSS; not so much in Javascript, but as this post highlights first and foremost, <strong>I'm always learning</strong>. I'm pretty good at using jQuery to add some cool things to the sites I build, but to really advance, I need to learn proper Javascript and stop piggybacking off a library such as jQuery. I also intend to learn PHP and other backend languages, so I can be a dual-developer (i.e front and back-end experience).</p>

<p>However, while, as I said above, I'm pretty decent at HTML and CSS, I am <strong>constantly</strong> learning new things. While it may seem easy to just keep building each project the same as the last one, to me, this just feels like I'm stagnating and I hate it.  To combat this, as I build a site, I have a list of new techniques to include in my next project - I add anything that I read about, for example, sizing in Rems and using ems in Media Queries (which are two that I used in this site). In this way, I try to keep on top of new and emerging techniques. <strong>I have to keep learning new techniques to stay on top of my game</strong>. There will always be people who will be better than me and I absolutely know that. If I want to stand a chance at being as good as them, I need to stay ahead of the curve and can't relapse.</p>

<p>This addiction to learning new stuff is part of the motivation to go to University. In one way, I'd love to be able to finish College in June and launch a career as a professional web designer. If I did this, I'm pretty sure life would be <strong>great</strong>. I'd try to keep up with the web industry and carry on building sites, each better than the last. However, I think I'd always want more; for instance, I often look up new stuff on Wikipedia - only the other day I was learning about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World">Seven Ancient Wonders of the World</a>. My ultimate aim is to be an app designer and developer - I know that if I became a web designer, there would be a time, be it in 6 months, 5 years or 10 years, I would look back on those years and feel I should have advanced my skill. <strong>I don't want that feeling</strong>. While I could learn app development on my own using excellent websites such as <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Treehouse</a> and <a href="https://tinkerlearn.com">TinkerLearn</a>, I don't think I'd have the motivation to actually go through with it and I'm pretty sure <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/56ed7faaad58">I'd be a better developer if I took the hit and went to Uni</a>, because I will have learnt the underlying principles of Object Orientated Development. Just to clarify, I will almost certainly be using those tools and more that I listed above, alongside University teaching - I already have a subscription to Treehouse and plan to buy TinkerLearn very soon and CodeSchool will likely follow. I've always done front-end as I found it a lot easier to get into; however I think I'm ready to learn about he more "hands-on" developing, rather than just making it look pretty. </p>
