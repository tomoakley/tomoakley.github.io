Calinoi was a site I built with the 5 Lines crew (I was project manager) for John Pack, CEO of Calinoi, who are a printing and packaging company based in Fremont, CA, across the pond in the USA. They were just starting up and needed a site that had all of their product range and kept visitors interested. John wanted it to be modern, with lots of white space and big, inviting images. We also built some Javascript applications that allows the visitor to view each range of products on a page (these are best displayed on <a href="http://calinoi.com/print">Print</a>, <a href="http://calinoi.com/packaging/">Packaging</a> and <a href="http://calinoi.com/signage/">Signage</a> pages). We used Wordpress as a base as John needed an easy way to quickly edit the information, and add new clients, testimonials and edit page content. To add a recent client or testimonial, all John has to is create a new Wordpress Post and publish it with the respective category, and it will automatically display on the correct part of the site. We really enjoyed working with John and hope to do more business with him and his printing partners again soon.
