5 Lines Creative is the web design agency I co-founded with <a href="http://twitter.com/eugeneross">Eugene Ross</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/erichoffman">Eric Hoffman</a> in September 2011 to build beautiful sites for small businesses and individuals that will last, both aesthetically and functionally, for many years to come. Since setting up shop, I've progressed leaps and bounds in how I build a website, interact with clients and show off my work. Eugene and Eric are great friends and colleagues to have and I'm so glad we set up 5 Lines. We're preparing some really awesome things for later this year, so if all goes to plan, there'll be a new era of 5 Lines in 2014!
