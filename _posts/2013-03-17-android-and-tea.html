Android and Tea is an upcoming web publication, aiming to be the greatest source for Android news and editorials in the world. While that's a huge aim, we think we can achieve success because many Android sites are badly built. While I'm an Apple guy at heart, I can relate to what Google have been doing recently, as they've been improving leaps and bounds in the last year or so, especially at designing apps. We're aiming to replicate this style of design, by using Android icons and design styles, while at the same time bringing our own special touch to it, icing it off with some delicious CSS3 animations, transformations and transitions. We hope to have a Beta out by June with the full release in August.
