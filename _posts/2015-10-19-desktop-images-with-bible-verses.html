<p>On OS X 10.11 El Capitan, Apple added an option to hide the menu bar and only show it when you hover at the top of the screen. Together with hiding the dock and having nothing on your desktop, this meant you could have full screen desktop images with no distractions. I was browsing through Apple's default desktop images that came with El Capitan and marvelling at how beautiful they were. Then I suddenly realised that all these images show the majesty of God's creation. I decided it'd be a great idea to add Bible verses to these, which remind of us this.</p>

<p>To start with I've only done a few, but I plan on doing more. You can download them <a href="http://5lines.co/wp-content/themes/_20145lines/assets/images/desktop-bible-verses.zip">here</a>. Also, if you have found an image that you think is suitable, I'd love it if you could tell me and I'll add it to the collection - tweet me at <a href="http://twitter.com/_tmkly">@_tmkly</a> or email me at <a href="mailto:tom.oakley@me.com">tom.oakley@me.com</a>. Thanks!</p>
