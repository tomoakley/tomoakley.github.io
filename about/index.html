<p>I'm Tom, a developer and designer for the web, with my eventual aim to be an iOS developer and designer. I am a Year 13 Student (making me 18 years old) at a Sixth Form College in Hampshire (South UK) (last year of High School to you Americans).</p>

<p>A goal which I want to achieve at some point in my life is to work for Apple (or Facebook, Google, Microsoft), but I suspect this may change in the next few years as I also hope to become increasingly involved in the startup culture.</p>

<p>I co-founded a design agency, <a target="_blank" href="http://5lin.es">5 Lines</a> in September 2011. Right now I'm a front-end developer and designer there during the time when I'm not doing college work.</p>

<p>I need to say thank you to a few people, because even though they might not know it (some of them don't even know me), they have provided me with a lot of motivation and inspiration over the past few years:</p>
