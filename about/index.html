<p>I'm Tom, a developer and designer for the web, with my eventual aim to be an iOS developer and designer. I have recently completed my A Levels at a Sixth Form in North Hampshire, UK and am attending Brunel University to study Computer Science in September 2013. During the Summer, I am working at <a href="http://rawnet.com">Rawnet</a> as a Junior Web Developer.</p>

<p>A goal which I want to achieve at some point in my life is to work for Apple (or Facebook, Google, Microsoft), but I suspect this may change in the next few years as I also hope to become increasingly involved in the startup culture.</p>

<p>I co-founded a design agency, <a target="_blank" href="http://5lin.es">5 Lines</a> in September 2011. We specialise in designing and developing bespoke sites for small businesses and enjoy taking our clients through the whole journey of making a website.</p>

<p>I need to say thank you to a few people, because even though they might not know it (some of them don't even know me), they have provided me with a lot of motivation and inspiration over the past few years:</p>
