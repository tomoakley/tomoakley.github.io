		<div class="entry-content">
			<p><p><strong>Firstly</strong>: I <strong>love</strong> to help people. I get a particular thrill and enjoyment out of helping someone achieve a goal. I think ultimately, I'd like to create, or be involved, in something, be it an app / website or company, that helps people learn things. I feel that this way, I can make a difference in people's lives instead of just providing a service or product that they use.</p>

<p><strong>Secondly</strong>: I started <a href="http://5lin.es">5 Lines Creative</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/euegeneross">Eugene</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/erichoffman">Eric</a> because I thought I could make a difference. However, the web design and development industry is so saturated it's very difficult to get people to notice you. We're doing good work, been featured on some websites, a couple of magazines and a book, but still not many people have noticed us. I really enjoy what I do, but to make a difference, I feel people have to notice me.</p>

<p>My experience with running 5 Lines has been polar; on the one hand, it's been amazing - not many 19 year olds have the skills, talent or guts to run their own business - yet I have. I've really enjoyed interacting with clients and designing / developing their website, and then hopefully, getting some great feedback. However, it's also been incredibly stressful: deadlines, taxes, banks, colleagues, unforeseen problems, marketing, payments, you name it, we've had it. I've had to deal with these, largely on my own. I don't this is right. What I've realised through my ongoing journey with 5 Lines is that everyone needs help, except they don't know where to get it from.</p>

<p>I've visited quite a few startup accelerators in London, where they provide offices and funding for young startups. This is really great as it allows these young startups to grow in a safe environment, and they can get advice from mentors and people who experienced in the various industries they are in. They also have the other startups in that particular space to talk to and get their perspective on their product.</p>

<p>Why can't the same thing be done for design agencies? This is what I want to do. Provide design agencies with the opportunity for their own office space and mentors, in return for a small amount of equity into their company. We could also link up to small businesses and startups around the local area to provide our agencies with work and potential employees. The secondary benefit of a lot of design agencies working together is that if one agency is getting a bit too much work, they could pass it on to another of our agencies or contract it out to them. We could provide support for them, using local accountants, lawyers and other professionals to give them advice and help them get on their way to paying taxes, fees and sorting any legal issues that may arise with clients or contractors. By providing this support, they wouldn't be so busy with admin details and could focus more on creating some great websites, leading to them making more money and doing better as business.</p>

<p>This type of support would have been invaluable to me 2 years ago, and in fact, it still would be invaluable now in December 2013.</p>

<p>For me, this would be making a difference in the way I've always wanted to. Helping people through the same struggles that I faced, and still face, and seeing them thrive in a safe environment where they can make mistakes without any fear of reprisals.</p>

<p>I need feedback on this idea. I need you to bring up sticky questions that I haven't answered here and validate my idea for me. Please email me at <a href="mailto:tom@tomoakley.me">tom[at]tomoakley.me</a>, or you can <a href="http://twitter.com/_tmkly">Tweet me (@_tmkly)</a>. Alternatively, I've put this post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6862095">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://news.layervault.com/stories/11241-acceleratorincubator-for-design-agencies">Designer News</a> so it can be discussed there as well. I'd really appreciate an upvote - just make sure you vote it directly from Hacker/Designer News instead of following the link above, otherwise the vote won't count.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.<br />

		<h3 class="entry-title"><a href="/blog/learning-addiction">Learning addiction</a></h3>
		<div class="entry-content">
			<p><p>A bit of background: I'm a student at a Sixth Form college in the UK and planning on going to University to study Computer Science/Software Engineering in September 2013. I design and develop websites, most of them built on Wordpress for external clients who own small businesses.</p>

<p>I really enjoy both sides of creating a website - the designing and developing in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I like to think I'm pretty proficient in HTML and CSS; not so much in Javascript, but as this post highlights first and foremost, <strong>I'm always learning</strong>. I'm pretty good at using jQuery to add some cool things to the sites I build, but to really advance, I need to learn proper Javascript and stop piggybacking off a library such as jQuery. I also intend to learn PHP and other backend languages, so I can be a dual-developer (i.e front and back-end experience).</p>

<p>However, while, as I said above, I'm pretty decent at HTML and CSS, I am <strong>constantly</strong> learning new things. While it may seem easy to just keep building each project the same as the last one, to me, this just feels like I'm stagnating and I hate it.  To combat this, as I build a site, I have a list of new techniques to include in my next project - I add anything that I read about, for example, sizing in Rems and using ems in Media Queries (which are two that I used in this site). In this way, I try to keep on top of new and emerging techniques. <strong>I have to keep learning new techniques to stay on top of my game</strong>. There will always be people who will be better than me and I absolutely know that. If I want to stand a chance at being as good as them, I need to stay ahead of the curve and can't relapse.</p>

<p>This addiction to learning new stuff is part of the motivation to go to University. In one way, I'd love to be able to finish College in June and launch a career as a professional web designer. If I did this, I'm pretty sure life would be <strong>great</strong>. I'd try to keep up with the web industry and carry on building sites, each better than the last. However, I think I'd always want more; for instance, I often look up new stuff on Wikipedia - only the other day I was learning about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World">Seven Ancient Wonders of the World</a>. My ultimate aim is to be an app designer and developer - I know that if I became a web designer, there would be a time, be it in 6 months, 5 years or 10 years, I would look back on those years and feel I should have advanced my skill. <strong>I don't want that feeling</strong>. While I could learn app development on my own using excellent websites such as <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a>, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Treehouse</a> and <a href="https://tinkerlearn.com">TinkerLearn</a>, I don't think I'd have the motivation to actually go through with it and I'm pretty sure <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/56ed7faaad58">I'd be a better developer if I took the hit and went to Uni</a>, because I will have learnt the underlying principles of Object Orientated Development. Just to clarify, I will almost certainly be using those tools and more that I listed above, alongside University teaching - I already have a subscription to Treehouse and plan to buy TinkerLearn very soon and CodeSchool will likely follow. I've always done front-end as I found it a lot easier to get into; however I think I'm ready to learn about he more "hands-on" developing, rather than just making it look pretty. </p>
