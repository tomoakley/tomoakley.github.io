	<h2 class="entry-title">Making a Difference</h2>
	
	<p class="entry-content"><p><strong>Firstly</strong>: I <strong>love</strong> to help people. I get a particular thrill and enjoyment out of helping someone achieve a goal. I think ultimately, I'd like to create, or be involved, in something, be it an app / website or company, that helps people learn things. I feel that this way, I can make a difference in people's lives instead of just providing a service or product that they use.</p>

<p><strong>Secondly</strong>: I started <a href="http://5lin.es">5 Lines Creative</a> with <a href="http://twitter.com/euegeneross">Eugene</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/erichoffman">Eric</a> because I thought I could make a difference. However, the web design and development industry is so saturated it's very difficult to get people to notice you. We're doing good work, been featured on some websites, a couple of magazines and a book, but still not many people have noticed us. I really enjoy what I do, but to make a difference, I feel people have to notice me.</p>

<p>My experience with running 5 Lines has been polar; on the one hand, it's been amazing - not many 19 year olds have the skills, talent or guts to run their own business - yet I have. I've really enjoyed interacting with clients and designing / developing their website, and then hopefully, getting some great feedback. However, it's also been incredibly stressful: deadlines, taxes, banks, colleagues, unforeseen problems, marketing, payments, you name it, we've had it. I've had to deal with these, largely on my own. I don't this is right. What I've realised through my ongoing journey with 5 Lines is that everyone needs help, except they don't know where to get it from.</p>

<p>I've visited quite a few startup accelerators in London, where they provide offices and funding for young startups. This is really great as it allows these young startups to grow in a safe environment, and they can get advice from mentors and people who experienced in the various industries they are in. They also have the other startups in that particular space to talk to and get their perspective on their product.</p>

<p>Why can't the same thing be done for design agencies? This is what I want to do. Provide design agencies with the opportunity for their own office space and mentors, in return for a small amount of equity into their company. We could also link up to small businesses and startups around the local area to provide our agencies with work and potential employees. The secondary benefit of a lot of design agencies working together is that if one agency is getting a bit too much work, they could pass it on to another of our agencies or contract it out to them. We could provide support for them, using local accountants, lawyers and other professionals to give them advice and help them get on their way to paying taxes, fees and sorting any legal issues that may arise with clients or contractors. By providing this support, they wouldn't be so busy with admin details and could focus more on creating some great websites, leading to them making more money and doing better as business.</p>

<p>This type of support would have been invaluable to me 2 years ago, and in fact, it still would be invaluable now in December 2013.</p>

<p>For me, this would be making a difference in the way I've always wanted to. Helping people through the same struggles that I faced, and still face, and seeing them thrive in a safe environment where they can make mistakes without any fear of reprisals.</p>

<p>I need feedback on this idea. I need you to bring up sticky questions that I haven't answered here and validate my idea for me. Please email me at <a href="mailto:tom@tomoakley.me">tom[at]tomoakley.me</a>, or you can <a href="http://twitter.com/_tmkly">Tweet me (@_tmkly)</a>. Alternatively, I've put this post on <a href="#">Hacker News</a> and <a href="#">Designer News</a> so it can be discussed there as well. I'd really appreciate an upvote - just make sure you vote it directly from Hacker/Designer News instead of following the link above, otherwise the vote won't count.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.<br />
