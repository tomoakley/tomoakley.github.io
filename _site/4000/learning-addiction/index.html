	<h2 class="entry-title">Learning Addiction</h2>
	
	<p class="entry-content">A bit of background: I'm a student at a Sixth Form college in the UK and planning on going to University to study Computer Science/Software Engineering in September 2013. I design and develop websites, most of them built on Wordpress for external clients who own small businesses.

I really enjoy both sides of creating a website - the designing and developing in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I like to think I'm pretty proficient in HTML and CSS; not so much in Javascript, but as this post highlights first and foremost, **I'm always learning**. I'm pretty good at using jQuery to add some cool things to the sites I build, but to really advance, I need to learn proper Javascript and stop piggybacking off a library such as jQuery. I also intend to learn PHP and other backend languages, so I can be a dual-developer (i.e front and back-end experience).

However, while, as I said above, I'm pretty decent at HTML and CSS, I am **constantly** learning new things. While it may seem easy to just keep building each project the same as the last one, to me, this just feels like I'm stagnating and I hate it.  To combat this, as I been build a site, I have a list of new techniques to include in my next project - I add anything that I read about, for example, sizing in Rems and using ems in Media Queries (which are two that I used in this site). In this way, I try to keep on top of new and emerging techniques. 
*I have to keep learning new techniques to stay on top of my game*. There are people who are better than me and I absolutely know that. If I want to be as good as them, I need to do this.

This addiction to learning new stuff is part of the motivation to go to University. In one way, I'd love to be able to finish College in June and launch a career as a professional web designer. If I did this, I'm pretty sure life would be **great**. I'd try to keep up with the web industry and carry on building sites, each better than the last. However, I think I'd always want more; for instance, I often-times look up new stuff on Wikipedia - only the other day I was learning about the [Seven Ancient Wonders of the World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World). I know that if I became a web designer, there would be a time, be it in 6 months, 5 years or 10 years, when I would feel that I could have done something more. **I don't want that feeling**. My ultimate aim is to build world-class apps for iOS and by extension, the Mac. While I could do this on my own using excellent such as [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com), [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) and [TinkerLearn](https://tinkerlearn.com), I don't think I'd have the motivation to actually go through with it and I'm pretty sure [I'd be a better developer if I took the hit and went to Uni](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/56ed7faaad58), because I've learnt the underlying principles of Object Orientated Development.
